      <section id="scope" class="scope">
        <h2>Scope</h2>
        <p>Web developers are building sophisticated applications where application performance is a critical feature. Web developers need the ability to observe the performance characteristics of their applications, and they want the ability to write more efficient applications, using well-defined interoperable methods.</p>

        <p>The Web Performance Working Group's deliverables include user agent features and APIs to observe and improve aspects of application performance, such as measuring network and rendering performance, responsiveness and interactivity, memory and CPU use, application failures, and similar APIs and infrastructure to enable measurement and delivery of better user experience. These deliverables will apply to desktop and mobile browsers and other non-browser environments where appropriate, and will be consistent with Web technologies designed in other working groups including HTML, CSS, WebApps, DAP and SVG.</p>

      <p>
        In addition to developing Recommendation Track documents, the Web Performance Working Group may provide review of specifications from other Working Groups.
      </p>
        <div id="section-out-of-scope">
          <h3 id="out-of-scope">Out of Scope</h3>
            <p>The following features are out of scope, and will not be addressed by this working group.</p>

            <ul class="out-of-scope">
            <li>methods to profile and instrument server side code;

          <h3>Success Criteria</h3>
          <p>In order to advance to  <a href="https://www.w3.org/2015/Process-20150901/#RecsCR" title="Proposed Recommendation">Proposed Recommendation</a>, each specification is expected to have at least two independent implementations of each of feature defined in the specification.</p>
          <p>Each specification should contain a section detailing any <a href='https://www.w3.org/TR/security-privacy-questionnaire/'>known security</a> or <a href="http://gregnorc.github.io/ping-privacy-questions/">privacy</a> implications for implementers, Web authors, and end users.</p>

        <p>
          To be successful, this Working Group is expected to have 5 or more active participants for its duration, including representatives from the key implementors of this specification, and active Editors and Test Leads for each specification. The Chairs, specification Editors, and Test Leads are expected to contribute half of a day per week towards the Working Group. There is no minimum requirement for other Participants.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group encourages questions, comments and issues on its public mailing lists and document repositories, as described in <a href='#communication'>Communication</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group also welcomes non-Members to contribute technical submissions for consideration upon their agreement to the terms of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy/">W3C Patent Policy</a>.

          Technical discussions for this Working Group are conducted in <a href="https://www.w3.org/2015/Process-20150901/#confidentiality-levels">public</a>. Meeting minutes from teleconference and face-to-face meetings will be archived for public review, and technical discussions and issue tracking will be conducted in a manner that can be both read and written to by the general public. Working Drafts and Editor's Drafts of specifications will be developed on a public repository, and may permit direct public contribution requests.
        </p>
        <p>
          Information about the group (including details about deliverables, issues, actions, status, participants, and meetings) will be available from the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2010/webperf/">Web Performance Working Group home page.</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          Most Web Performance Working Group teleconferences will focus on discussion of particular specifications, and will be conducted on an as-needed basis.
        </p>
        <p>
          This group primarily conducts its technical work in its <a href="https://www.w3.org/wiki/Web_Performance/Publications">public repositories</a>. There is also a public mailing list <a id="public-name" href="mailto:public-web-perf@w3.org">public-web-perf@w3.org</a> (<a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-web-perf/">archive</a>).  The public is invited to contribute to the github repositories and post messages to the list. Regular activity summaries around the github repositories will be provided.

        <h2>
          Decision Policy
        </h2>
        <p>
          This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due process, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2015/Process-20150901/#Consensus"> W3C Process Document (section 3.3</a>). Typically, an editor or other participant makes an initial proposal, which is then refined in discussion with members of the group and other reviewers, and consensus emerges with little formal voting being required.</p>
        <p>
           However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress, but consensus is not achieved after careful consideration of the range of views presented, the Chairs may call for a group vote, and record a decision along with any objections.
        </p>
        <p>
          To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, any resolution (including publication decisions) taken in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference will be considered provisional until 10 working days after the publication of the resolution in draft minutes sent to the working group's mailing list.

          If no objections are raised on the mailing list by the end of the response period, the resolution will be considered to have consensus as a resolution of the Working Group.
        </p>
        <p>
          All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved unless and until new information becomes available, or unless reopened at the discretion of the Chairs or the Director.
        </p>
        <p>
          This charter is written in accordance with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/policies#Votes">W3C Process Document (Section 3.4, Votes)</a>, and includes no voting procedures beyond what the Process Document requires.
